1. Design a Stack with Increment Operation: The objective is to design a custom stack of a given maximum size that supports push, pop and increment operations. Push adds an element to the top of the stack, if the stak has not reached max size. Pop removes and retrieves an element from the top of the stack. Increment increments the bottom k elements of the stack by a given value.
