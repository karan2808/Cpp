1. Design a Stack with Increment Operation: The objective is to design a custom stack of a given maximum size that supports push, pop and increment operations. Push adds an element to the top of the stack, if the stak has not reached max size. Pop removes and retrieves an element from the top of the stack. Increment increments the bottom k elements of the stack by a given value. 

2. First Missing Positive: Given an integer array, find the smallest missing positive number.

3. Pivot Index: Given an integer array, find the pivot index i such that the sum over all elements at indices less than i is equal to the sum over all elements with indices greater than i.

4. Partition Equal Subset Sum: Given a non-empty array nums containing only positive integers, the objective is to find if the array can be partitioned into subsets of equal sum. 

5. Pick T from N: Given an array of N numbers, the objective is to return T numbers picked at random without replacement. 

6. Merge Intervals: Given an array of intervals where intervals[i] = [starti, endi], merge all overlapping intervals, and return an array of the non-overlapping intervals that cover all the intervals in the input. 

7. Product of Array except self: Given an array of integers, the goal is to return the product of the array elements except self. If we consider an element at index 5, the product will consist of the product of elements from 0 to 4 and 6 onwards.

8. Find the Duplicate Number: Given an array of integers nums containing n + 1 integers, where each one is in the range 1 to n. The objective is to find a number that is repeated using constant space.
