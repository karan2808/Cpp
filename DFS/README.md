1. Range Sum BST: Given a binary search tree, the objective is to find the sum of the node values between low and high values.

2. Increasing Order Search Tree: Given the root of a binary search tree, the objective is to rearrange the tree such that the leftmost node is the root and every node has only right child. 

3. Surrounded Regions: Given a 2D board containing 'X' and 'O's, the objective is to flip all 'O's int surrounded regions to 'X's. Any 'O' that is not on the border and is not connected to the 'O's on the border will be flipped.
