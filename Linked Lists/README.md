1. Copy List with Random Pointer: Given a linked list, each node contains an additional random pointer which could point to any node in the list or null. The objective is to make a deep copy of the linked list.

2. Merge k Sorted Lists: You are given an array of k linked-lists lists, each linked-list is sorted in ascending order. The objective is to merge all linked lists into one sorted linked list and return the root. 

3. Swap Nodes in Pairs: Given a linked list, swap every two adjacent nodes and return its head.
