1. Remove Outermost Paranthesis: Given a valid paranthesis string S made up of primitive paranthesis strings (ones that cannot be split further), the objective is to remove the outermost paranthesis of each primitive string.

2. Remove All Adjacent Duplicates In String: Given a string s of lowercase letters, duplicate removal  consists of choosing two adjacent duplicate letters and removing them. The objective is to remove duplicates until there are no adjacent duplicates left.

3. Array With Stack Operations: Given an array target and an integer n, the objective is to output an array of stack operations that lead to the formation of target while reading numbers from 1 to n.

4. Queue using Stack: Implementation of a queue using two stacks.

5. Min Stack: A stack that supports push, pop, top, getMin (get the minimum element) in constant time.

6. Valid Paranthesis: A program to check the validity of a given string contaning paranthesis.

7. Stack Using Queue: Implementation of a stack using a single queue.

8. Next Greater Element 1: For given integer arrays nums1 and nums2, where nums1 is the subset of nums2, the objective is to find the next greater element for every element in nums1, in nums2.

9. Decode String: Given an encoded string, the objective is to decode it. The encoding rule is k[encoded_string], where the encoded_sting inside the brackets is repeated k times. 

10. Binary Tree Inorder Traversal: Given the root node of binary tree, the objective is to find the inorder traversal of the tree.
