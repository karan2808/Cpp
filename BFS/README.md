1. Word Ladder Problem: The objective is to find the minimum number of transformations required from start word to end word, one letter at a time. Each transformed word has to be present in the provided dictionary of words. We use breadth first search to traverse level by level, enumerating all possible variations of a word by changing one letter at a time.

2. Clone Graph: Given a reference node in a connected undirected graph, the objective is to return a deep copy of the graph.

3. N Array Tree Level Order Traversal: Given an n-array tree, return level order traversal of its nodes values. 

4. Minimum Depth of Binary Tree: Given a binary tree, find the minimum depth of the tree. 

5. Binary Tree Right Side View: Given a binary tree, return an array containing the node values of the tree seen from the right side.
