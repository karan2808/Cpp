1. Regular Expression Matching: Given two strings the task is to implement a regular expression matching with support for '.' and '*' where '.' can match any character and '*' can match zero or more of the preceeding element.

2. Maximum Subarray Sum: Given an array, the task is to find the maximum sum of a contiguous sub array. 

3. Unique Paths: A robot is located at top left corner of an m x n grid. It can only move right or down. Objective is to find the number of ways to reach the bottom right corner of the grid.

4. Decode Ways: A message containing letters A - Z can be encoded into numbers from 1-26, we need to find number of ways to decode this string. 

5. Unique Paths 2: A robot is located at top left corner of an m x n grid. It can only more right or down. The Objective is to find number of ways to reach the bottom right corner of the grid while avoiding obstacles. 

6. CanIWin: Two players play a game. Each takes turn and selects a number from 1 to maxChoosableInteger. The first one to cross the desiredTotal sum wins. Each number can only be selected once. If a player plays first, the objective is to find if that player can force a win if both players play optimally.

7. Mininum Path Sum: Given a m x n grid, a robot starts at top left. The objective is to find the minimum path sum from top left to bottom right if the robot can move only right or down.
