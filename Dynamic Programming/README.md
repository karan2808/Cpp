1. Regular Expression Matching: Given two strings the task is to implement a regular expression matching with support for '.' and '*' where '.' can match any character and '*' can match zero or more of the preceeding element.

2. Maximum Subarray Sum: Given an array, the task is to find the maximum sum of a contiguous sub array. 

3. Unique Paths: A robot is located at top left corner of an m x n grid. It can only move right or down. Objective is to find the number of ways to reach the bottom right corner of the grid.

4. Decode Ways: A message containing letters A - Z can be encoded into numbers from 1-26, we need to find number of ways to decode this string. 

5. Unique Paths 2: A robot is located at top left corner of an m x n grid. It can only more right or down. The Objective is to find number of ways to reach the bottom right corner of the grid while avoiding obstacles. 

6. CanIWin: Two players play a game. Each takes turn and selects a number from 1 to maxChoosableInteger. The first one to cross the desiredTotal sum wins. Each number can only be selected once. If a player plays first, the objective is to find if that player can force a win if both players play optimally.

7. Mininum Path Sum: Given a m x n grid, a robot starts at top left. The objective is to find the minimum path sum from top left to bottom right if the robot can move only right or down. 

8. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock with Cooldown: An array of prices contains price of a given stock on a given day (ith element is price of the stock on day i). The goal is to find maximum profit while not engaging in multiple transactions at the same time, i.e. its mandatory to sell the stock before buying it again, and, after the stock is sold, it cannot be bought on the next day.

9. Coin Change: Given coins of different denominations and a total amount of money 'amount'. The objective is to find the maximum amount of coins that are needed to make up that total 'amount'. There are infinite number of each kind of coin.

10. Coin Change 2: Given coins of different denominations and a total amount of money 'amount'. The objective is to find the number of combinations of coins that can sum to 'amount'.

11. Unique Binary Search Trees: Given an integer n, the objective is to find the total number of structurally unique BSTs (Binary Search Trees) which have exactly n nodes of unique values from 1 to n.
